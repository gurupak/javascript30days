        In the name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful All Praise is due to
        Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, the [One Who] Sustains the Heavens and Earths,
        Director of all that is created, who sent the Messengers (may the peace and
        blessings of Allah be upon all of them) to rational beings, to guide them and
        explain the religious laws to them with clear proofs and undeniable arguments. I
        praise Him for all of His bounties. I ask Him to increase His Grace and
        Generosity. I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah
        alone, who has no partner, the One, Who Subdues, the Generous, the Forgiving. I
        bear witness that our leader Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, His beloved
        and dear one, the best of all creation. He was honoured with the Glorious Qur’an
        that has been an enduring miracle throughout the years. He was also sent with his
        guiding Sunnah that shows the way for those who seek guidance. Our leader Muhammad
        has been particularised with the characteristic of eloquent and pithy speech, and
        simplicity and ease in the religion. May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon
        him, the other Prophets and Messengers, all of their families and the rest of the
        righteous.

        <h1>How It All Began</h1> Nearly four thousand years ago, in the Sumerian town of Ur in the
        valley of the river Euphrates, lived a young man named Abraham. The people of Ur
        had once worshipped Allah but as time passed they forgot the true religion and
        started praying to idols, statues made of wood or clay and sometimes even of
        precious stones. Even as a small child Abraham could not understand how his
        people, and especially his father, could make these images with their own hands,
        call them gods, and then worship them. He had always refused to join his people
        when they paid respect to these statues. Instead he would leave the town and sit
        alone, thinking about the heavens and the world about him. He was sure his people
        were doing wrong and so alone he searched for the right way. One clear night as he
        sat staring at the sky he saw a beautiful shining star, so beautiful that he cried
        out: „This must be Allah!' He looked at it in awe for some time, until suddenly it
        began to fade and then it disappeared. He turned away in disappointment saying: I
        love not things that set. (Qur'an 6.77)
      </p>
      <p>
        On another night Abraham was again looking at the sky and he saw the rising moon,
        so big and bright that he felt he could almost touch it. He thought to himself:
        This is my Lord. (Qur'an 6.78) But it was not long before the moon set as well.
        Then he said, Unless my Lord guide me, I surely shall become one of the folk who
        are astray. (Qur'an 6.78) Abraham then saw the beauty and splendor of the sunrise
        and decided that the sun must be the biggest and most powerful thing in the
        universe. But for the third time he was wrong, for the sun set at the end of the
        day. It was then that he realized that Allah is the Most Powerful, the Creator of
        the stars, the moon, the sun, the earth and of all living things. Suddenly he felt
        himself totally at peace, because he knew that he had found the Truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he said unto his father and his folk: What do you worship? They said: We
        worship idols, and are ever devoted to them. He said: Do they hear you when you
        cry? Or do they benefit or harm you? They said: Nay, but we found our fathers
        acting in this manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        He said: See now that which you worship, You and your forefathers! Lo! they are
        (all) an enemy to me, except the Lord of the Worlds. Who created me, and He guides
        me, And Who feeds me and waters me. And when I sicken, then He heals me. And Who
        causes me to die, then gives me lift (again) And Who, I ardently hope, will
        forgive me my sin on the Day of judgement. (Qur'an 26.70-82) One day, while all
        the townspeople were out, Abraham angrily smashed all the idols with his right
        hand except for one which was very large. When the people returned they were
        furious.
      </p>
      <p>
        They remembered the things Abraham had said about the idols. They had him brought
        forth before everyone and demanded, 'Is it you who did this to our gods, 0
        Abraham?' Abraham replied, But this their chief did it. Ask them, if they are able
        to speak.' The people exclaimed, 'You know they do not speak.' 'Do you worship
        what you yourselves have carved when Allah created you and what you make?' Abraham
        continued, 'Do you worship instead of Allah that which cannot profit you at all,
        nor harm you?' (Qur'an 37.95-6)(Qur'an 21.66)
      </p>

      <img src="./images/river.jpg" class="align-left slide-in" style="width:200px;height:500px" />

      <p>
        Finally, Abraham warned them, Serve Allah, and keep your duty unto Him; that is
        better for you if you did but know. You serve instead of Allah only idols, and you
        only invent a lie. Lo! those whom you serve instead of Allah own no provision for
        you. So seek your provision from Allah, and serve Him, and give thanks unto Him,
        (for) unto Him you will be brought back.(Qur'an 29. 16-17)
      </p>

      <p>
        The people of Ur decided to give Abraham the worst punishment they could find: he
        was to be burnt to death. On the chosen day all the people gathered in the centre
        of the city and even the King of Ur was there. Abraham was then placed inside a
        special building filled with wood. The wood was lit. Soon the fire became so
        strong that the people were pushed back by the flames. But Allah said: “O fire, be
        coolness and peace for Abraham”. (Qur'an 21.69) The people waited until the fire
        had completely died down, and it was then that they saw Abraham still sitting
        there as though nothing had happened! At that moment they were utterly confused.
        They were not, however, moved by the miracle that had just happened before their
        very eyes. Still Abraham tried to persuade his own dear father, who was named
        Azar, not to worship powerless, un-seeing, un-hearing statues. Abraham explained
        that special knowledge had come to him and implored his father, 'So follow me and
        I will lead you on the right path. 0 my father! Don't serve the Devil.' But Azar
        would not listen. He threatened his son with stoning if he continued to reject the
        gods of Ur. He ordered Abraham to leave the city with these words: 'Depart from me
        a long while.' Abraham said, 'Peace be upon you! I shall ask my Lord's forgiveness
        for you. Surely He was ever gracious to me.‟ (Qur'an 19.43-7)
      </p>

      <img src="./images/3.jpg" class="align-left slide-in" style="width: 200px;height: 500px;"/>

      <p>
        Imagine how terrible it must have been for him to leave his home, his family and
        all that he knew, and set out across the wilderness into the unknown. But at the
        same time, how could he have remained among people who did not believe in Allah
        and who worshipped statues? Abraham always had a sense that Allah cared for him
        and he felt Allah near him as he traveled. At last, after a long hard journey, he
        arrived at a place by the Mediterranean Sea, not far from Egypt. There he married
        a noble woman by the name of Sarah and settled in the land of Palestine. Many
        years passed but Abraham and his wife were not blessed with any children. In the
        hope that there would be a child, and in keeping with tradition, Sarah suggested
        that Abraham should marry Hagar, her Egyptian handmaid. Soon after this took
        place, Hagar had a little boy named Ishmael. Some time later Allah promised
        Abraham another son, but this time the mother of the child would be his first
        wife, Sarah. This second son would be called Isaac. Allah also told Abraham that
        from his two sons-Ishmael and Isaac-two nations and three religions would be
        founded and because of this he must take Hagar and Ishmael away from Palestine to
        a new land. These events were an important part of Allah's plan, for the
        descendants of Ishmael would form a nation from which would come a great Prophet,
        who would guide the people in the way of Allah. This was to be Muhammad (pbuh),
        the Messenger of Allah (pbuh). From the descendants of Sarah's child, Isaac, would
        come Moses and Jesus.
        <img src="./images/4.jpg" class="align-right slide-in" style="width: 200px;height: 200px;" />So it was
        that Abraham, Hagar, and Ishmael left Palestine. They traveled for many days until
        finally they reached the arid valley of Bacca later to be called Mecca), which was
        on one of the great caravan routes. There was no water in the valley and although
        Hagar and Ishmael only had a small supply of water left, Abraham left them there
        knowing Allah would take care of them. Soon all the water was gone. The child
        began to grow weak from thirst. There were two hills nearby, one called Safa and
        the other Marwah. Hagar went up one hill and looked into the distance to see if
        she could find any water, but found none. So she went to the other hill and did
        the same. She did this seven times. Then sadly she returned to her son, and to her
        great surprise and joy she found a spring of water bubbling out of the earth near
        him. This spring, near which the mother and child settled, was later called
        Zamzam. The area around it became a place of rest for the caravans travelling
        across the desert and in time grew into the famous trading city of Mecca.
      </p>

      <p>
        From time to time Abraham traveled from Palestine to visit his family and he saw
        Ishmael grow into a strong young man. It was during one of these visits that Allah
        commanded them to rebuild the Ka'bah-the very first place where people had
        worshipped Allah. They were told exactly The Life of the Prophet Muhammad (Peace
        and blessings of Allah be upon him) 6 where and how to build it. It was to be
        erected by the well of Zamzam and built in the shape of a cube. In its eastern
        corner was to be placed a black stone that had fallen to earth from heaven. An
        angel brought the stone to them from the nearby hill of Abu Qubays. Abraham and
        Ishmael worked hard to rebuild the Ka'bah and as they did so they prayed to Allah
        to send a Prophet from among their descendants. And when Abraham and Ishmael were
        raising the foundations of the House, (Abraham prayed): 'Our Lord! Receive this
        from us; Thou, only Thou, art the All-hearing, the All-knowing; Our Lord! And make
        us submissive unto Thee and of our seed a nation submissive unto Thee, and show us
        our ways of worship, and turn toward us. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Relenting,
        the Merciful. Our Lord! And raise up in their midst a messenger from among them
        who shall recite unto them Thy revelations, and shall instruct them in the
        Scripture and in wisdom and shall make them grow. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the
        Mighty, Wise. (Qur'an 2.127-9) When the Ka'bah was completed, Allah commanded
        Abraham to call mankind to pilgrimage to His Holy House. Abraham wondered how
        anyone could hear his call. Allah said, 'You call and I will bring them.' This was
        how the pilgrimage to the Ka'bah in Mecca was established and when Muslims make
        the pilgrimage today they continue to answer the age-old call of Abraham.

      <p>
        <h1>The Children of Ishmael</h1> Over the years Ishmael's children themselves had children.
        His descendants increased and formed tribes which spread out all over Arabia. One
        of these tribes was called Quraysh. Its people never moved away from Mecca and
        always lived near the Ka'bah. One of the duties of the leader of Quraysh was to
        look after those who came on pilgrimage to the Ka'bah. The, pilgrims would come
        from all over Arabia and it was a great honor to provide them with food and water.
        As time passed, however, the Arabs stopped worshipping Allah directly and started
        bringing idols back with them from the different countries they visited. These
        idols were placed at the Ka'bah, which was no longer regarded as the Sanctuary of
        Allah, as Abraham had intended it. It was, however, still respected by the Arabs.
        Around this time the well of Zamzam disappeared beneath the sand. Also at this
        time, Qusayy, one of the leaders of Quraysh, became ruler over Mecca. He held the
        keys of the temple and had the right to give water to the pilgrims, to feed them,
        to take charge of meetings, and to hand out war banners before battle. It was also
        in his house that Quraysh settled their affairs. After Qusayy's death, his son
        'Abdu Manaf, who had become famous during his father's lifetime, took over the
        leadership of Quraysh. After him came his son Hashim. It is said that Hashim was
        the first to begin the two great caravan journeys of Quraysh, one in the summer to
        Syria and the north, and one in the winter to Yemen and the south. As a result,
        Mecca grew rich and became a large and important centre of trade. One summer
        Hashim went north to buy goods to sell in Yemen. On his way he stopped in Yathrib
        to trade in the market and there he saw a beautiful woman. She was Salma', the
        daughter of 'Amr ibn Zeid, who was from a much respected family. Hashim proposed
        marriage to her and was accepted because he was an honorable and distinguished
        man. In time, Salma' gave birth to a beautiful son and as some of his hair was
        white they called him Shaybah, which in Arabic means grey-haired'. Mother and son
        stayed in the cooler, healthier climate of Yathrib, while Hashim returned to
        Mecca, but he would visit them each time he took his caravan to the north. During
        one of these journeys, however, Hashim became ill and died. Shaybah, a handsome,
        intelligent boy, grew up in his uncle's house in Yathrib. He was proud of being
        the son of Hashim ibn 'Abdi Manaf, the head of Quraysh, guardian of the Ka'bah and
        protector of the pilgrims, even though he had not known his father, who had died
        while Shaybah was very young.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Hashim's death his brother al-Muttalib took over his duties and
        responsibilities. He traveled to Yathrib to see his nephew, Shaybah, and decided
        that as the boy would one day inherit his father's place, the time had come for
        him to live in Mecca. It was hard for Salma', Shaybah's mother, to let her son go
        with his uncle but she finally realized that it was for the best. Al-Muttalib
        returned to Mecca, entering the city at noon on his camel with Shaybah behind him.
        When the people of Mecca saw the boy they thought he was a slave and, pointing at
        him, called out „Abd alMuttalib', 'Abd' being the Arabic for 'slave'. Al-Muttalib
        told them that Shaybah was not a slave but his nephew who had come to live with
        them. From that day on, however, Shaybah was always affectionately called Abd
        al-Muttalib. On the death of alMuttalib, who died in Yemen where he had gone to
        trade, 'Abd alMuttalib took his place. He became the most respected member of his
        family, loved and admired by all. He was, however, unlike those Arabs who had
        given up the teachings of Abraham.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h1>Promise At Zamzam</h1>  The well of Zamzam, which disappeared when the Arabs placed
        idols at the Ka'bah, remained buried under the sand. Thus, for many years the
        people of Quraysh had to fetch their water from far away. One day 'Abd al-Muttalib
        was very tired from doing this and fell asleep next to the Ka‟bah. He had a dream
        in which he was told to dig up Zamzam. When he woke up he was puzzled because he
        did not know what Zamzam was, the well having disappeared many years before he was
        born. The next day he had the same dream, but this time he was told where to find
        the well. 'Abd al-Muttalib had one son at that time, and together they began to
        dig. The work was so difficult that „Abd al-Muttalib made an oath to Allah that if
        one day he were to have ten sons to help him and stand by him, in return he would
        sacrifice one of them in Allah's honor. After working for three days they finally
        found the well of Zamzam. Pilgrims have been drinking from it ever since. The
        years passed by and 'Abd alMuttalib did have ten sons. They grew into fine, strong
        men and the time came for him to keep his promise to Allah. He told his sons about
        the promise and they agreed that he had to sacrifice one of them To see which one
        it would be, they decided to draw lots, which was the custom of Quraysh when
        deciding important matters. 'Abd al-Muttalib told each son to get an arrow and
        write his own name upon it and then to bring it to him. This they did, after which
        he took them to the Ka'bah where there was a man whose special task it was to cast
        arrows and pick one from among them. This man solemnly proceeded to do this. On
        the arrow he chose was written the name of 'Abd Allah, the youngest and favorite
        son of 'Abd al-Muttalib. Even so, the father took his son near the Ka'bah and
        prepared to sacrifice him. Many of the Quraysh leaders were present and they
        became very angry because 'Abd Allah was very young and much loved by everyone.
        They tried to think of a way to save his life. Someone suggested that the advice
        of a wise old woman who lived in Yathrib should be sought, and so 'Abd al-Muttalib
        took his son and went to see if she could decide what to do. Some of the Meccans
        went with them and when they got there the woman asked, 'What is the price of a
        man's life?' They told her, 'Ten camels', for at that time if one man killed
        another, his family would have to give ten camels to the dead man's family in
        order to keep the peace among them. So the woman told them to go back to the
        Ka‟bah and draw lots between 'Abd Allah and ten camels. If the camels were chosen,
        they were to be killed and the meat given to the poor. If 'Abd Allah was picked
        then ten more camels were to be added and the lots drawn again and again until
        they finally fell on the camels. The Life of the Prophet Muhammad (Peace and
        blessings of Allah be upon him) 10 „Abd al-Muttalib returned to the Ka‟bah with
        his son and the people of Mecca. There they started to draw lots between „Abd
        Allah and the camels, starting with ten camels. „Abd al-Muttalib prayed to Allah
        to spare his son and everyone waited in silence for the result. The choice fell on
        „Abd Allah, so his father added ten more camels. Again the choice fell on „Abd
        Allah, so they did the same thing again and again, adding ten camels each time.
        Finally they reached one hundred camels, and only then did the lot fall on the
        camels. „Abd Allah was saved and everyone was very happy. 'Abd al-Muttalib
        however, wanted to make sure that this was the true result so he repeated the draw
        three times and each time it fell on the camels. He then gave thanks to Allah that
        He had spared „Abd Allah's life. The camels were sacrificed and there was enough
        food for the entire city, even the animals and birds. 'Abd Allah grew up to be a
        handsome young man and his father eventually chose Aminah, the daughter of Wahb,
        as a wife for him. It was a good match for she was the finest of Quraysh women and
        'Abd Allah the best of the men. He spent several months with his wife but then he
        had to leave her and travel with one of the caravans to trade with Syria. On his
        way back to Mecca from Syria 'Abd Allah became ill and had to stop off in Yathrib
        to recover. The caravan, however, continued on its way and arrived back in Mecca
        without him. On hearing of 'Abd Allah's illness, „Abd al-Muttalib sent another
        son, al-Hareth, to bring 'Abd Allah back to Mecca, but he was too late. When he
        arrived in Yathrib „Abd Allah was dead. Aminah was heartbroken to lose her husband
        and the father of the child she would soon give birth to. Only Allah knew that
        this orphan child would one day be a great Prophet.
